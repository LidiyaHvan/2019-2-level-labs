You said if you could fly
You would fly far - far into the sky
So all you'd ever know
Is that blue - that blue sky up above?
You've yet to learn what the pain from true sadness is like
You've only had but a taste
But you're a moth to the flame
When all my feelings reach you
They'll no longer be mute
For on that day
They'll live in spoken words
From in a dream
When you awake into the world
You no longer know
If you could only spread your wings and fly away
You said if you could fly
You would fly far - far into the sky
And you would set your aim
On the clouds all around that endless sky
The moment you break free
You'll finally find - find all you seek
And it's all waiting there
In that blue - in that blue sky up above
In that blue - in that blue sky up above
In that blue - in that blue sky up above
